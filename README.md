A port of Gmod's big city map

This is a 1-to-1 port of Gmod's Big City map. The map is hugeâ€”too big to be seen in full even with unlimited view distance. To compensate for that, there are multiple copies of the NPCs and stores placed near the sewage and canal areas, which is also where you can fish. It still has all of the secret areas, and I made use of the lighthouse and ladders to teleport you on top of three buildings once you use their doors. There are also a few bounce mushrooms placed around the map, including on top of buildings, to help you quickly get wherever you want to go.

# Important info

- The map's model is made by the Sketchfab artist "CHANO": https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gm-big-city-6cfb71e7b08744eeb4c59fbfb4fd9963

- The mod is too big to upload to GitHub, so instead, this GitHub page will be used to host the open-source files. If you want to get the normal build of this map, please use the Thunderstore page: https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/SnailUSB/GmodBigCity/

- To upload the exported map to github, I had to compress it into a 7z file instead of zip, as that was the only way to get it under the file size limit on here. If you want to install the build from this github page instead of thunderstore, you will have to install it manually, or turn it into a zip file so hook line and sinker can accept it.
